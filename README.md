# Conference reports

<div align="justify">

A lot of very interesting content is communicated in conferences. However, there is often no public record of that content. As such, the wider scientific community cannot learn from a conference it did not attend. This GitHub repository aims to fill that gap by creating a community where we can all come together and build wiki summaries using the GitHub wiki. Notifications of new content made available on this wiki will be posted on our Reddit group here and on our Twitter account here. You are encouraged to try and post your wiki entries elsewhere as well, e.g. Medium. This is a new community and all ideas on how to make it better are welcome!

### Disclaimer

These summaries do not aim to be comprehensive and merely reflect take-away messages of conference participants. For any objections to what is being said, please file an "Issue" under the "Issues" tab of our GitHub repository.
