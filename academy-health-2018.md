### Empirical evidence on the impact of incentives on consumer health behaviors and health care decisions

This primarily referred to using financial insentives to promote healthy behavior. The researchers tested whether financial incentives can improve adherence to exercise advice in those with ischemic heart disease and found a substantial positive effect. Very interesting perspectives on using such incentives to improve health by Mishra Patel. Interesting comment by another speaker that there is little correlation between quality and choice of provider because copay tends to be similar across any provider; as such, providers have no reason to compete on cost and quality.
